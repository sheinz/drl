Use standard high beam lamps with reduced power to implemen daytime running lamps.\r\nThe controller is implemented using ATMEL ATTiny13A microcontroller.\r\nIt uses PWM to control lamp brightness. \r\n\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/sheinz/drl/master/doc/drl_4.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Features:**\r\n- Use PWM to control hi beam lamp power.\r\n- Automatically turns on after engine is started. Detects voltage increase to determine if engine is running.\r\n- Automatically turns off when low beam lamps is on.\r\n- Provides DRL brightness configuration by clicking a switch. Each click slightly increases brightness.\r\n- The brightness of the DRL is stored in EEPROM. \r\n- Can be completely disabled by configurin brightness that equal zero.\r\n- If a device is malfunctioning it records errors and blinks hi beam lamps at start. \r\n- The error count is cleared after clicking a switch.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Build**\r\n\r\nIn order to build the source code the following packages should be installed:\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install gcc-avr\r\n    sudo apt-get install avr-libc\r\n    sudo apt-get install cmake\r\n    \r\nIf you encounter errors like these:\r\n    \r\n    ld: crttn13a.o: No such file: No such file or directory\r\n    undefined reference to `__eerd_byte_tn13a'\r\n    \r\nCopy libraries crttn13a.o and libc.a into tiny-stack subdirectory:\r\n\r\n    sudo cp /usr/lib/avr/lib/avr25/crttn13a.o /usr/lib/avr/lib/avr25/tiny-stack/\r\n    sudo cp /usr/lib/avr/lib/avr25/libc.a /usr/lib/avr/lib/avr25/tiny-stack/\r\n    \r\nTo build and upload the firmware:\r\n    \r\n    mkdir drl-build\r\n    cd drl-build\r\n    cmake ../drl\r\n    make\r\n    make upload\r\n    \r\n\r\n--------------\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/sheinz/drl/master/doc/drl_1.jpg)\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/sheinz/drl/master/doc/drl_3.jpg)\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/sheinz/drl/master/doc/schematic.png)\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/sheinz/drl/master/doc/pcb.png)\r\n",
